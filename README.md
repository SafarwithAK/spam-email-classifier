## 🎯 Project Overview

Spam emails are a major cybersecurity and productivity concern.  
This project uses **TF-IDF vectorization** and a trained **Machine Learning classifier** to accurately detect spam emails.

- ✅ Accuracy: **97.96%**
- ✅ Real-time prediction
- ✅ Confidence score (probability)
- ✅ Dark / Light mode toggle
- ✅ Deployed on Streamlit Cloud

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Lowercasing text
   - Tokenization
   - Stopword removal
   - Stemming (Porter Stemmer)

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - TF-IDF Vectorizer

3. **Model Training**
   - Supervised ML classifier (trained offline)
   - Saved using Pickle

4. **Prediction**
   - Spam / Not Spam
   - Probability-based confidence
